# Guarantee: marginal coverage under exchangeability, over calibration data
# and a fresh test pair (conditional on training). Observed coverage varies
# between finite test sets. Subgroups and changed markets need separate checks.
# Calibration targets coverage. An aleatoric-epistemic split needs further
# modelling assumptions.
# in the plot there is one point that is not covered in the interval
